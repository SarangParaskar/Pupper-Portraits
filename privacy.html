            In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to
            protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.

            We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:
             Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information
            in a specific purpose.


             Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate
            business interests.


             Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal
            information to fulfill the terms of our contract.


             Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to
            comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process,
            such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet
            national security or law enforcement requirements).


             Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate,
            prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations
            involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation
            in which we are involved.
            More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following
            situations:
             Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third party
            vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require
            access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email
            delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to
            use tracking technology on the Services or Apps, which will enable them to collect data about how you
            interact with the Services or Apps over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze
            and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. Unless
            described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties
            for their promotional purposes.

             Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations
            of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
            another company.

             Third-Party Advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the
            Services or Apps. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites
            that are contained in web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements about
            goods and services of interest to you.

             Offer Wall. Our Apps may display a third-party hosted “offer wall.” Such an offer wall allows third-party
            advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for acceptance and
            completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in our mobile application and be
            displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you
            click on an offer wall, you will leave our mobile application. A unique identifier, such as your user ID,
            will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account.

            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
            policy unless otherwise required by law.
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
            other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for
            longer than 2 years.
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
            in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
            processing until deletion is possible.

            security measures.
